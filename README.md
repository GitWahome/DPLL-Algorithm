The Input method is as listed in the KB i.e [{A},{C,D}]. A, C, D Are instances of literal. 
An overload on __neg__ has been performed to allow for false valued and negative literals
This is not exactly DPLL, It was a BRUTEFORCE approach but I optimized the String format
Conjuctive Normal Form generator. Check the DPLL and Brutefoorce IPNYB Notebool as it contains a version
That includes the DPLL. UnitClause and Pure Heuristics and implemented in this.  It also takes inputs in
the same manner but modifies them to a new form to function correctly. It is a modified version of AIMA
and Gordon's implementations, Links in the acknowledgement.
